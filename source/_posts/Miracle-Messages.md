I came across Miracle Messages when I started looking into what I could do to help the homeless. Founder Kevin F. Adler started Miracle Messages in honor of his uncle Mark, who suffered from schizophrenia and lived on-and-off the streets for 30 years. Miracle Messages' mission is to mobilize the internet to reunite the world, and aims to reunite 1 million homeless people with their loved ones by 2021.

What are Miracle Messages? Miracle Messages are short video messages from homeless individuals to their long-lost loved ones, delivered by a global network of volunteers via social media. Miracle Messages has been featured in 200+ media outlets, including the New York Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, NPR, People, and NowThis, whose video surpassed 20 million views and 300,000 shares.

To date, 90% of loved ones have received their message positively, and 40% of reunions have lead to stable housing or living with family again.
