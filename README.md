My name is Krystel Rae Davis. I created this blog in order to chronicle my research into homelessness in Austin and the people I meet along the way. This site is completely open source - I am trying to make as much information as public as possible and want to encourage others to do the same. 

**I'm looking to work with folks who are interested in creating software and other tangible solutions to this problem.**

If this is something you are interested in, you can reach me at krae@homelessatx.com

*Let's start something good.*
